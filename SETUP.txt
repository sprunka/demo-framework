1) Copy the root folder to the hard drive. Record the path (referred to later in this document as PROJECT_HOME)
	a) owner of this directory can be anyone. Permissions should be set 755 for all directories and 644 for all files.
	b) There is also a "tmp" directory for log files and the files used during a search. This directory should be writable by the apache group.
		i) chown -R root:apache tmp/
		ii) chmod -R 775 tmp/
2) Edit PROJECT_HOME/config/config.php to reflect the changes appropriate to the installation environment.
	a) the DS used throughout this file is a platform agnostic way of using a directory separator.
		i) In a Linux environment, a forward slash "/" can be used instead, for ease of copying and pasting paths.
		ii) In a Windows environment, a backslash (escaped by another backslash) "\\" can be used. 
3) Edit your Apache config (or add/edit the alias file) to include the following: (where PROJECT is defined as the root path of the application
#################################################
Alias /PROJECT "PROJECT_HOME/public/" 

<Directory "PROJECT_HOME/public/">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AllowOverride all
        Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>
#################################################
4) Restart your Apache httpd server.
5) Test the set up.
